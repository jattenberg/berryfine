An attempt to experiment with a few technologies:
- fastapi
- strawberry
- sqlalchemy
- [render](dashboard.render.com)
- [strawberry-sqlalchemy-mapper](https://github.com/expedock/strawberry-sqlalchemy-mapper)
- next.js
- [nba_api](https://github.com/swar/nba_api)

and maybe some others. 

also considering NBA data from [balldontlie](https://www.balldontlie.io/#get-all-players) because who doesn't love Rasheed?


## GIST:
1. enable postgres db
2. find useful dataset
3. define sqlalchemy Models
4. alembic schema changes
5. strawberry mappings


## Usage:

```
# makes the virtualenv in ./venv
./build.sh

# inits the alembic stuff
venv/bin/alembic init alembic

# set up 

```

# TODO:
1. secret management for cloud
